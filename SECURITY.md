# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

For all package released by Idea Pool, the current major (and its minor) 
releases are supported by security updates.

In all Idea Pool projects utilizing external packages, our goal is to ensure 
the regular maintenance and updates of these dependencies. However, it is 
important to note that we assume no responsibility for the security or 
maintenance of those packages.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please contact us on the ideapool@epam.com
e-mail address. Depending on the severity of the issue, we aim to resolve all
security issues in reasonable time.
